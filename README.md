# Minimal React / Express Server

For development work without needing to run concurrent servers for React and Express, as would be the case if the `create-react-app` package were used.

Inspect `webpack.config.js` and `.babelrc` for the configuration of this server.

Express server logic goes in `index.js`.

React logic goes in `/src/index.js`.

Start the server with `npm start`.
